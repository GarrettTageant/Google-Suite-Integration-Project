# Google-Suite-Integration-Project
My first excuse to start actually using GitHub for documentation practice

This is a description of the steps I took to create and deploy AutoMargin
AutoMargin is a simple Gemini-created script designed to create an adjustable cell margin(in my case 15%) in Google Sheets to make things look nicer without needing to manually adjust the cell column width every time.
This is my first ever automation and workflow/cloud environment "project" I've ever worked on, but it's enough of a hassle that I decided to document the process, as it's a skill I intend to develop for my future in IT/Cybersecurity
